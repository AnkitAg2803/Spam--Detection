# FAKE--NEWS-DETECTION
This project implements a spam detection system using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning techniques. The model is trained to classify messages as spam or ham (not spam) using the Naïve Bayes classifier.
Dataset

The dataset used for training and evaluation is spam.csv, which contains labeled SMS messages.

Technologies Used

Python

Pandas

NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)

Scikit-learn

Model Training and Evaluation

Preprocesses the text data (tokenization, stopword removal, TF-IDF transformation)

Splits data into training and testing sets

Trains a Naïve Bayes classifier

Evaluates performance using accuracy and classification report

Results

The trained model achieves high accuracy in classifying spam and ham messages.
